## What is curl?

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "7ffa5e801b"
```

`@part1`
**curl** (short for: Client for URLs) is a Unix command line tool for transferring data from or to a server.  In the data science world, `curl` is often used to download data from HTTP(s) sites and FTP servers.  

First, to check if `curl` is installed correctly on your system, type the following in your command line console:
``` 
man curl 
```

If `curl` has **not** been installed, you will see an output similar to the following:

`curl command not found.`

To install `curl` for your operating system, follow the link [here](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html).

## Learning curl Syntax

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "93b7df1fa7"
```

`@part1`
The basic syntax for `curl` has the following structure: 
```
curl [optional flags] [URL]
```
The URL is required for the `curl` command to run successfully.  This indicates the location of the server where the data files are stored.  

`curl` supports a large number of protocol calls for data stored on servers, such as `HTTP`, `HTTPS`, `FTP`, and `SFTP`. (e.g. `ftp://ftpserver.com/datafilename.txt`)

The optional flags always starts with one or two dashes (e.g. `-o`, `--http2 `).  For a full list of the options available, refer back to:
```
man curl
```
