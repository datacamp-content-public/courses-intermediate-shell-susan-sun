## What is curl?

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "7ffa5e801b"
```

`@part1`
**curl** (short for: Client for URLs) is a Unix command line tool for transferring data from or to a server.  In the data science world, `curl` is often used to download data from HTTP(s) sites and FTP servers.  

First, to check if `curl` is installed correctly on your system, type the following in your command line console:
``` 
man curl 
```

If `curl` has **not** been installed, you will see an output similar to the following:

`curl command not found.`

To install `curl` for your operating system, follow the link [here](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html).

## Browsing the curl Manual

```yaml

```

`@part1`
If `curl` **has been** installed correctly, your console will now look something like this:

To scroll through the full manual for `curl` (which is fairly long), press `enter`.  
To exit the manual and return to your console, press `q`.

## Learning curl Syntax

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "93b7df1fa7"
```

`@part1`
The basic syntax for `curl` has the following structure: 
```
curl [optional flags] [URL]
```
The URL is required for the `curl` command to run successfully.  This indicates the location of the server where the data files are stored.  

`curl` supports a large number of protocol calls for data stored on servers, such as `HTTP`, `HTTPS`, `FTP`, and `SFTP`. 

The optional flags always starts with one or two dashes (e.g. `-o`, `--http2 `).  For a full list of the options available, refer back to:
```
man curl
```

## Downloading a Single File Using curl

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "7e71f8d9f6"
```

`@part1`
In this example, we will download a single file and save it locally on our machine.  

Let's pretend the file we need is hosted at the following URL:
`https://websitename.com/datafilename.txt`

Aside from the URL location, we also need the optional flag `-O` (the uppercase alphabet, not zero).  The command will look this:
```
curl -O https://websitename.com/datafilename.txt
```
The command above will save the data file with its original name `datafilename.txt` in the same directory location as your current console.  To rename the file in the same step as the download, use the lower case `-o` option.  See below:

```
curl -o renameddatafilename.txt https://websitename.com/datafilename.txt
```

## Downloading Multiple Files Using curl and Wildcards

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "4ede58c906"
```

`@part1`
Oftentimes, a server will host multiple data files, with similar data file names.  Instead of repeating the `curl` command for each data file, it is possible to use wildcards to pull all files in one go.

For example, pretend that we have the following files named sequentially:

`https://websitename.com/datafilename001.txt`
`https://websitename.com/datafilename002.txt`
...
`https://websitename.com/datafilename100.txt`

The following will download every file hosted on `https://websitename.com/` as long as the file name starts with `datafilename` and ends in `.txt`.

```
curl -O https://websitename.com/datafilename*.txt
```

## Downloading Multiple Files Using curl and Wildcards

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "6e54be2d5c"
```

`@part1`
Continuing with the previous example:

`https://websitename.com/datafilename001.txt`
`https://websitename.com/datafilename002.txt`
...
`https://websitename.com/datafilename100.txt`

The following will download every file sequentially starting with `datafilename001.txt` and ending with `datafilename050.txt`.

```
curl -O https://websitename.com/datafilename[001-050].txt
```


`@script`
Continuing with the previous example:

The following will download every file sequentially starting with `datafilename001.txt` and ending with `datafilename050.txt`.

```
curl -O https://websitename.com/datafilename[001-050].txt

## Downloading Multiple Files Using curl and Wildcards

```yaml

`@part1`
Continuing with the previous example:

`https://websitename.com/datafilename001.txt`
`https://websitename.com/datafilename002.txt`
...
`https://websitename.com/datafilename100.txt`

It is also possible to increment through the files and download every Nth file.  For example, the following command will download every 10th file such as `datafilename010.txt`, `datafilename020.txt`, ... `datafilename100.txt`.

```
curl -O https://websitename.com/datafilename[001-100:10].txt
```

## Preemptive Troubleshooting with curl

```yaml
type: "FullCodeSlide"
key: "1b903b83bd"
```

`@part1`
As we move large data files around, internet connections can timeout, halting our download.  To make sure that our download resumes and progress is not lost, `curl` has two particularly useful option flags:

`-L`     Redirects the HTTP URL if a 300 error code is found.

`-C`     Resumes a previous file transfer if it timed out before completion.

Putting everything together, our command to download all 100 files from the previous example would look something like this: 

```
curl -L -O -C https://websitename.com/datafilename[001-100].txt
```

The order of the flags specified will not alter the outcome of the script.
